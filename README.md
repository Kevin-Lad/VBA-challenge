# VBA-challenge
I collaborated with my tutor on some of the code. In class, we did not discuss "constant" variables, but during the tutor session, he told me about these and I feel like it helped clean up my code.
In class, while discussing loops, we used "i" for our counter. During the tutoring session, my tutor suggested that I create a varibale in place of "i", which I called input_row.
